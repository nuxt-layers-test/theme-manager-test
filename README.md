# Theme Manager Test

> **In short:** a minimal Nuxt application template for independent capability acceptance and presentation testing in the Nuxt Layers ecosystem.

> **Purpose:** Dedicated acceptance application for
> `nuxt-layers/theme-manager`, derived from
> `nuxt-layers-test/application-test-template`.

This repository validates Theme Manager independently using
its public contracts and the shared Nuxt test application shell.

The initial acceptance environment uses Theme Manager test
mode without IAM, an external database or Docker.

## Shared template documentation

Use GitHub's **Use this template** action to create a separate test application for a capability. Each generated repository owns its capability dependencies, server-side composition, scenarios, fixtures and acceptance results. The template owns no capability-specific implementation.

## Getting started

Install the Node.js version declared in `.node-version`, select it with `fnm use`, and use the pnpm version declared in `package.json`. From the generated project:

```powershell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

The local development server defaults to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Boundaries

- Consume a capability only through its published `CONTRACT.md` and public exports.
- Keep capability behaviour, administrative screens and server-side enforcement in their owning capability.
- Configure application navigation, fixtures and test scenarios in each derived repository.
- Consume Theme Manager's public semantic vocabulary; do not define another theme system.
- Use British English, accessible interaction and Nuxt's built-in internationalisation-friendly primitives.

## Shared test application

The template provides a themed application shell, a separate homepage at `/`, an admin/test dashboard at `/admin`, responsive collapsible navigation and Theme Manager in explicit local `test` mode. Derived test applications add capability-specific scenarios and navigation; they do not need to implement their own application shell.

Open `http://localhost:3000/` for the homepage, `/admin` for the test dashboard or `/theme-manager` to exercise Theme Manager. The homepage has no administration sidebar; the logo in the test-area top bar returns home, while the homepage links into `/admin`. Sidebar sections can be expanded and collapsed, and mobile navigation is overlaid.

This is a **local-only development and test template**. Theme Manager test mode provides unauthenticated management endpoints, so do not publish the template as a public server.

The Theme Manager dependency tracks accepted development `master`; after its revision changes, refresh and commit the dependency lockfile to capture the exact tested commit. Before release adoption, replace the moving Git reference with an immutable release reference.

## Top application bar

The shared shell includes a logo/identity link, a Theme Manager-backed Appearance menu (theme picker and system/light/dark preference), and a reserved authentication-status area.

The authentication area deliberately reports **Not signed in**; no authentication layer or sign-in action is supplied by the template. Derived test applications can connect a real authentication capability later. The colour-mode preference is stored in the test application's `test-colour-mode` cookie; it is separate from Theme Manager's selected-theme cookie. As in the reference site, the host controls the `html.dark` class.

The header is part of the shared test application and does not add UI dependencies to Theme Manager.

## Configurable branding

The homepage, top bar and sidebar share `TestBrand`, which reads `testBrand` from the host application's `app/app.config.ts`. The initial logo is expected at `public/nuxt-layers-logo.png`; until that image is added, a simple fallback mark is shown.

Derived test applications can override `testBrand.name`, `testBrand.logoSrc` and `testBrand.logoAlt` in their own application config without editing shared shell components. The name defaults to **Nuxt Layers Test** if omitted or blank, is rendered as ordinary Vue text (not HTML), and is truncated when space is limited. The logo path must be a local absolute path (for example `/my-brand.png`); invalid paths fall back to the placeholder mark. Text is shown beside the logo on the homepage and expanded sidebar, and on wider toolbar layouts. Keep brand selection host-owned; a future Configuration capability can supply these settings through the host without introducing a Theme Manager dependency.

## Capability navigation identity

The Theme Manager sidebar link uses the `/theme-manager-logo.png` public asset owned by the composed Theme Manager layer. Its text label remains accessible. The image is optional and hidden on load failure. This link requires Theme Manager PR #18 to be merged and the consumer lockfile refreshed to its accepted revision; verify the asset responds at `/theme-manager-logo.png` before merging this integration PR.
